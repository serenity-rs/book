# Shard Messenger

### Good to know:
[Sharding]

#### Quick overview:
* Enables to handle current gateway-connection.

### Type Documentation
```rust
pub struct Context {
    pub data: Arc<RwLock<ShareMap>>,

    pub shard: ShardMessenger,

    pub shard_id: u64,

    #[cfg(feature = "cache")]
    pub cache: CacheRwLock,

    #[cfg(feature = "http")]
    pub http: Arc<Http>,
}
```

### Shard Messenger
Right after `data` follows the `shard`-field, a [ShardMessenger] communicates
with the related shard. To understand what *related* means, we need to grasp the following concept: When Serenity dispatches a command, we do not know on which
shard we are operating on. Luckily [Context] got us covered and provides us
with the needed information. It gives us the [ShardMessenger] in charge of
communicating with the right shard. Hense if we get an event for shard 5,
we would be provided with the messenger for shard 5 as well.

If you do not understand what sharding is, the [ShardMessenger] might seem very confusing.<br>
One single shard can be simplified to a connection to Discord, each connection receives events from Discord.<br>
So, if we have two shards each will receive events for around one half of all
guilds. As a result, if we have 100 shards the guilds will distributed across those 100 shards.<br>
Moreover, Discord requires a maximum amount of 2,500 guilds per shard,
but fear not, Serenity handles this automatically.

### Shard Id
The third field on [Context], `shard_id`, is a plain number refering to the shard's ID. Thus it actually
just informs us on which shard the current thread is operating on. As the name
[Context] somewhat conveys, it provides us information about the current
circumstances, contextual background, just like a shard number would be.
