# Serenity's Internals

Serenity is a big beast composed of multiple modules.
Each module focuses on a different aspect of bot-development and the Discord-API.\
There is a gateway and an HTTP-module, but also a command-framework-module.

This collection of chapters aims to explain these different modules in-depth.
