# The Serenity Book

The book is currently based on Serenity `v0.6.3`. If you are using an earlier
version of the `v0.6`-series, feel free to update, all patch-releases
(third digit) are stable releases and won't break your code.

The book creation is an ongoing effort and still incomplete.
Incomplete content is prefixed with *WIP* and placeholders with *TODO*.

It provides:
* In-depth information on the modules.
* How to port from v0.5 to v0.6.
* Troubleshooting.

Planned:
* Tutorial
* Examples

Please enjoy!
